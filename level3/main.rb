# I have not the time to do but in peudo code I would do:
# a new class called CountryDistance with a find_distance method
# select the instance of this class I am interested in on the EtaBuilder class (as the find_carrier)
# pass it as a new argument on the PackageEtaBuilder class and calculate the date in the build_eta method (a new method called calculate_eta_with_trhesold can be a good idea)
